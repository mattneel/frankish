# STATE — frankish live handoff

Updated: 2026-07-02 (M0+M1 session)
Phase: M1 complete (tag m1-done); M2 not started.
Tree: green — `make test` passes; clean-clone `make ci` verified (exit 0).

## Next action
M2 Derived interpreter per docs/SPEC.md §13 (read SPEC §7.1 first): Eval
trait; interpreter over func/arith/scf/cf; two-way diff (interp vs JIT)
live on all goldens. Wiring is pre-built: append the interpreter to
frk_harness::runner::default_runners() and the standing corpus tests +
make diff become the two-way gate automatically; flip reference_runner()
to the interpreter (D-008) in the same change.
Exit: L3 enforced in CI.

## In flight
Nothing.

## For the human
- Review ⚑ D-005 (host stack ruling) in docs/DECISIONS.md — made on your
  behalf. Evidence through M1 supports it: melior 0.27.2 builds, JITs,
  runs pass pipelines, and prints IR against LLVM/MLIR 22.1.8 with no
  binding gap encountered.

## Milestone log
m0-done — Shipped: SPEC §12 workspace skeleton (7 crates + sandbox/);
versions.env as the single pin point (RUST_TOOLCHAIN=1.96.0,
LLVM_MAJOR=22, LLVM_VERSION_TESTED=22.1.8, MELIOR_VERSION=0.27.2) with
scripts/check-pins.sh asserting every mirror stays in sync; make
setup|build|test|ci over POSIX scripts (L6); frk-core context() with
eager dialect loading (LANDSCAPE segfault warning); smoke verifier
jit_add_i64 — builder-API add(i64,i64) → convert-to-llvm →
ExecutionEngine, asserts 40+2=42; clean-clone make ci green. Learned:
apt.llvm.org hosts need libmlir-22-dev AND libpolly-22-dev
(llvm-config --libs names Polly; tblgen-rs fails to link without it —
the cairo-native footgun; setup.sh doctor checks both). melior 0.27
API notes: invoke_packed requires llvm.emit_c_interface on the func;
ExecutionEngine::new takes 5 args (enable_pic new); verify() lives on
the OperationLike trait; conversion passes are macro-generated,
create_to_llvm() is the one-shot lowering. Cheats awaiting promotion:
none — no dialect work happened; frnksh is an honest placeholder that
prints its pre-M8 status.

m1-done — Shipped: docs/canon.md v0 + frk_harness::canon (the single
§7.4 filter; CRLF/CR→LF, one trailing LF, i64 rendering, float policy
pinned); golden engine (goldens/<suite>/<case>/ layout, strict
`// frk-case:` directives, check writes gitignored output.actual,
bless reports changed/unchanged, zero-case corpus is an error);
6-case upstream corpus (arith/scf.for-i64/scf.if/cf.cond_br/func.call)
with expected outputs computed by hand before the runner ran, syntax
validated via mlir-opt 22; differential scaffold (diff_corpus, BTreeMap
matrix, L3 escalation text in the report) live on the corpus via
default_runners(); stage dumps (00-parsed + NN-<pass> per shared
pipeline table, out dir recreated whole, never goldened — docs/
stages.md); frnksh test/bless/diff/emit + make bless|diff. Ledger:
D-027 (custom golden runner, format, entry protocol, pipeline),
D-028 (single-pass-manager stage dumps). Learned: scf.for takes i64
induction directly (no index detour needed); the pipeline
scf-to-cf → convert-to-llvm → reconcile-unrealized-casts covers all
six cases; melior pass constructors are macro-named from C API symbols
(strip Conversion/Convert/Pass, snake-case). Cheats awaiting
promotion: none. Known wart (accepted for v0): `emit --stages` default
out dir uses the source file stem, so corpus files (all named
case.mlir) collide on out/stages/case — pass --out for those.

## Session log

    Session end: 2026-07-02 (second entry this session)
    Milestone/step: M1 complete, tagged m1-done
    Green? yes — make test green; clean-clone scripts/ci.sh exit 0
    Did:
    - canon contract + filter; golden engine + 6-case corpus; diff
      scaffold; stage dumps; frnksh subcommands; make bless|diff
    - D-027, D-028 appended; goldens/README.md + docs/canon.md +
      docs/stages.md written
    Next: M2 — Eval trait + interpreter over func/arith/scf/cf; append
    it to default_runners() and flip reference_runner() (D-008); exit =
    L3 enforced in CI
    Landmines:
    - run cargo via make (exports MLIR_SYS_220_PREFIX/TABLEGEN_220_PREFIX)
    - melior is alpha: build contexts via frk_core::context() only
    - never bless without an L2 justification line in the commit; the
      bless report prints changed/unchanged per case to keep you honest
    - goldens comparison happens ONLY through frk_harness::canon — do
      not add a second normalization anywhere

    Session end: 2026-07-02
    Milestone/step: M0 complete, tagged m0-done
    Green? yes — make test green; clean-clone make ci exit 0
    Did:
    - workspace skeleton per SPEC §12; versions.env + check-pins.sh
    - melior =0.27.2 pinned; frk-core context(); smoke jit_add_i64 green
    - installed libmlir-22-dev + libpolly-22-dev on this host; setup.sh
      doctor now checks for both so the next machine gets named hints
    - clean-clone make ci verified; README status refreshed; tagged; pushed
    Next: M1 harness v0 (SPEC §7): golden runner + bless + docs/canon.md
    v0 + stage dumps + differential scaffold
    Landmines:
    - run cargo via make (it exports MLIR_SYS_220_PREFIX /
      TABLEGEN_220_PREFIX); bare cargo without those exported will pick a
      wrong or absent LLVM
    - melior is alpha: build contexts via frk_core::context() (eager
      dialect loading) — unloaded-dialect access can segfault (LANDSCAPE)
